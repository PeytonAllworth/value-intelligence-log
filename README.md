Today I began planning out the basics around a job i was contacted about to assist in watching digital asset values and oter metrics. I have been hired to find mutiple metrics and have an expectation of it running smoothly for their clients. I will call on redundant data sets to have backups in place if an API is temporarily unreliable. I also made sure the numbers from both sources are close enough before triggering anything to prevent false data being set out to client. The client signed off on how the tool will handle alerts based on market changes and other relevant metrics. In respect to the clients competitive business metrics my code, specific logic, and custume models are kept private. This README.md can be used to get surface level insights for my contracted work.
